  description: Regarding our graphical identity, in terms of colours or fonts, we
    choose to stick to the corporate identity. We could have been doing something
    slicker, cleaner, with a lot of negative space and everything but we acknowledge
    that effective communication is also how people see us. We don't believe to be
    a spin-off or a research lab. We are Smile's Innovation Team, so we share 100%
    of the Smile's branding. Check-out with the marketing & communication team to
