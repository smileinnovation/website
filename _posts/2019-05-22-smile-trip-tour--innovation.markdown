During summer 2018, Smile did its “Tour” of agencies to talk about innovative projects with clients, and to introduce them to new methodologies, evangelise them about what could be the next big thing in their industry with the Innovation Dpt. Futurology talk.

Thibault, Fabrice and Fabien went on the road to meet our clients and showcase Lego SeriousPlay methology, since they just get certified as official registered facilitator.
