Continuing our experimentation with [Snips](http://snips.ai) we released a very promising integration with Magento to enable voice commerce becoming a reality.

User can now start shopping using their home assistant in the morning, continue at work from his desktop on the Magento website and do a last check in public transportation from his app, using touch interface or his voice, at his convenience.
