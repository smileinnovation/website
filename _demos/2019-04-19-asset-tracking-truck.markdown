description: Helping Embeded & Connected System department at Smile, we worked to improve the scenario of the demo in order to match the canva of an international show like Amazon Summit.
---
By simplifying the demonstration and building custom monitoring dashboard, we showed that the open-source solution based on Odoo that Smile developped is completly adaptable to every customer needs. Tweaking the internal behavior, building completly new web and native application on top of it and connecting multiple devices using MQTT brocker isn't something impossible.

The demo is now showcase in AWS France Innovation corner in Paris and visible to all AWS customers that comes by their office. We are working on a clone to be feature in conventions or in Smile Asni√®res's office.
