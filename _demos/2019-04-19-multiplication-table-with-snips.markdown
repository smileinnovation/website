Alain Rouen, our head of technology at Smile Innovation, played a little bit with [Snips](http://snips.ai) technology that help him to create vocal assistant running on his own hardware, with absolutely no voice record, no personal information of any kind going to a 3rd party server or cloud service. 

The demo can be installed on a Raspberry Pi and can be autonomously be shown to any clients. It's now part of our collection of voice demo we are running on devices we bring with us to tech show. 

Alain wrote on our medium a complete article covering the basics of how voice assistants are working, which on-premise, privacy by design solutions you can use and how to deploy the demo to try it yourself. [Read about it here](https://medium.com/smileinnovation/hey-snips-e4372508443e).
